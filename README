NAME
    TOML - Parser for Tom's Obvious, Minimal Language.

SYNOPSIS
        use TOML qw(from_toml);

        my $toml = slurp("~/.foo.toml");
        my $data = from_toml($toml);

        # With error checking
        my ($data, $err) = from_toml($toml);
        unless ($data) {
            die "Error parsing toml: $err";
        }

DESCRIPTION
    "TOML" implements a parser for Tom's Obvious, Minimal Language, as
    defined at <https://github.com/mojombo/toml>.

    "TOML" exports a single subroutine, "from_toml", that transforms a
    string containing toml to a perl data structure. This data structure
    complies with the tests provided at
    <https://github.com/mojombo/toml/tree/master/tests>.

    If called in list context, "from_toml" produces a ("hash",
    "error_string") tuple, where "error_string" is "undef" on non-errors. If
    there is an error, then "hash" will be undefined and "error_string" will
    contains (scant) details about said error.
