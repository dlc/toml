NAME
    TOML - Parser for Tom's Obvious, Minimal Language.

SYNOPSIS
        use TOML qw(from_toml to_toml);

        # Parsing toml
        my $toml = slurp("~/.foo.toml");
        my $data = from_toml($toml);

        # With error checking
        my ($data, $err) = from_toml($toml);
        unless ($data) {
            die "Error parsing toml: $err";
        }

        # Creating toml
        my $toml = to_toml($data);

DESCRIPTION
    "TOML" implements a parser for Tom's Obvious, Minimal Language, as
    defined at <https://github.com/mojombo/toml>. "TOML" exports two
    subroutines, "from_toml" and "to_toml",

FUNCTIONS
    from_toml
        "from_toml" transforms a string containing toml to a perl data
        structure or vice versa. This data structure complies with the tests
        provided at <https://github.com/mojombo/toml/tree/master/tests>.

        If called in list context, "from_toml" produces a ("hash",
        "error_string") tuple, where "error_string" is "undef" on
        non-errors. If there is an error, then "hash" will be undefined and
        "error_string" will contains (scant) details about said error.

    to_toml
        "to_toml" transforms a perl data structure into toml-formatted
        string.
