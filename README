DESCRIPTIOn
    "TOML" implements a parser for Tom's Obvious, Minimal Language, as
    defined at <https://github.com/mojombo/toml>.

    "TOML" exports a single subroutine, "from_toml", that transforms a
    string containing toml to a perl data structure. This data structure
    complies with the tests provided at
    <https://github.com/mojombo/toml/tree/master/tests>.
